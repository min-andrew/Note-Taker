# Note-Taker

Created a note taking application.

## Description

I created an application where you can write, save, and delete your notes. Some skills included in this project were the use of the express application framework, the building of a backend, middleware, routes, and deployment on Heroku.

## Getting Started

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
